To get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- Node.js
- npm
- npx

## Installation

Clone the project repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd your-project
```
Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
## Usage
To start the development server and view the app in your browser, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```
This will open your browser and load the app at http://localhost:3000. You will be able to interact with the 3D scenes and navigate between different worlds using the portals.
